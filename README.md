# CrediSense
This CrediSense application aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
